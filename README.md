# Remote drawer

Code for an ST7735 display used as (near) real-time drawing canvas. Draw on the canvas on the web interface and see it real-time on the display. The software is tested on the following boards:

* ESP32 DEVKIT V1

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The software is written, compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE (v1.8.13). You could use the online Arduino IDE or other software, but I recommend using the version you can download on [this page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). In order to use the Arduino IDE as tool for uploading to the ESP, there are several steps to follow. Please visit the following tutorials:

* https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/

### Installing

Clone the repository. Navigate to the `remoteDrawer` folder and upload `remoteDrawer.ino` and the `data` folder (with the [ESP32 Sketch Data Upload](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/) option).
